Introduction
============
This R package provides function for connecting to various DBMSs. 

Features
========
- Create connections to the various database platforms:
  - MicrosoftSQL Server
  - Oracle
  - PostgresSql
  - Microsoft Parallel Data Warehouse (a.k.a. Analytics Platform System)
  - Amazon Redshift
  - Apache Impala
  - Google BigQuery
  - IBM Netezza
- Statements for executing queries with 
  - Error reporting to file
  - Progress reporting
  - Multiple statements per query
- Support for fetching data to ffdf objects
- Insert data frame to a database table
- Supports the DBI interface
- Integrates with RStudio's Connections tab

Examples
========
```r
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms="mysql", 
                                             server="localhost",
                                             user="root",
                                             password="blah",
                                             schema="cdm_v4")
conn <- connect(connectionDetails)
querySql(conn,"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM person")
disconnect(conn)
```

```r
## regular data insert
insertTable(connection = connection, 
            tableName = "scratch.somedata", 
            data = data, 
            dropTableIfExists = TRUE, 
            createTable = TRUE, 
            tempTable = FALSE, 
            useMppBulkLoad = FALSE)
            
## bulk data insert with Redshift or PDW
insertTable(connection = connection, 
            tableName = "scratch.somedata", 
            data = data, 
            dropTableIfExists = TRUE, 
            createTable = TRUE, 
            tempTable = FALSE, 
            useMppBulkLoad = TRUE)
```

Technology
============
DatabaseConnector is an R package using Java's JDBC drivers. 

System Requirements
===================
Requires R. Also requires Java 1.6 or higher (Oracle Java is recommended. [Issues](https://github.com/OHDSI/DatabaseConnector/issues/8) have been reported when using GCJ.) 

Dependencies
============
Please note that this package requires Java to be installed. If you don't have Java already intalled on your computed (on most computers it already is installed), go to [java.com](http://java.com) to get the latest version.

To be able to use Windows authentication for SQL Server, you have to install the JDBC driver. Download the .exe from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11774) and run it, thereby extracting its contents to a folder. In the extracted folder you will find the file sqljdbc_4.0/enu/auth/x64/sqljdbc_auth.dll (64-bits) or sqljdbc_4.0/enu/auth/x86/sqljdbc_auth.dll (32-bits), which needs to be moved to location on the system path, for example to c:/windows/system32.

DatabaseConnector also depends on the OHDSI DatabaseConnectorJars and SqlRender packages.

For Redshift Bulk Mpp inserts, the cloudyR aws S3 pacakge is required.

Getting Started
===============
To install the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("DatabaseConnector")
