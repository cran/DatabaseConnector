\description{
\code{createConnectionDetails} creates a list containing all details needed to connect to a
database. There are three ways to call this function:
\itemize{
  \item \code{createConnectionDetails(dbms, user, password, server, port, extraSettings,
        oracleDriver, pathToDriver)}
  \item \code{createConnectionDetails(dbms, connectionString, pathToDriver)}
  \item \code{createConnectionDetails(dbms, connectionString, user, password, pathToDriver)}
}
}
\details{
This function creates a list containing all details needed to connect to a database. The list can
then be used in the \code{\link{connect}} function.

\section{Windows authentication for SQL Server}{


To be able to use Windows authentication for SQL Server (and PDW), you have to install the JDBC
driver. Download the version 9.2.0 .zip from \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/release-notes-for-the-jdbc-driver?view=sql-server-ver15#92-releases}{Microsoft} 
and extract its contents to a folder. In the extracted folder you will find the file
sqljdbc_9.2/enu/auth/x64/mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.0.x64.dll (64-bits) or
ssqljdbc_9.2/enu/auth/x86/mssql-jdbc_auth-9.2.0.x86.dll (32-bits), which needs to be moved to
location on the system path, for example to c:/windows/system32. If you not have write access to
any folder in the system path, you can also specify the path to the folder containing the dll by
setting the environmental variable PATH_TO_AUTH_DLL, so for example
\code{Sys.setenv("PATH_TO_AUTH_DLL" = "c:/temp")} Note that the environmental variable needs to be
set before calling \code{connect} for the first time.

  dbms = "postgresql",

  user = "root",

disconnect(conn)
